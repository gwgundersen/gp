Installation
============

To install, add the following to your bash profile (`~/.bash_profile`):

```
alias gp="/path/to/gp.sh"
```

You may need to make the file executable:

```
chmod +x /path/to/gp.sh
```

We recommend adding `.gp_exclude` and `.gp_exclude_global` to your [global .gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore).
